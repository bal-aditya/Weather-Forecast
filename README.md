# Weather Monitoring and Prediction

Weather monitoring  can help us to monitor the temperature and humidity by using a single sensor and predict the weather using ML tools.

## Sensors Used 

- DHT11 sensor - Measures the temperature and humidity. 
- MQT2 sensor - Measures the air quality.
- LDR sensor - Luminance detection.

## Libraries Used

- DHT Sensor Library by [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)
- Unified Sensor  by [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)
